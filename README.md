# Regression Project Summary

## Project Goals

> - Document code, process (data acquistion, preparation, exploratory data analysis and statistical testing, modeling, and model evaluation), findings, and key takeaways.
> - Create modules (acquire.py, prepare.py) that make my process repeateable and my report (notebook) easier to read and follow.
> - Ask exploratory questions of my data that will help me understand more about the attributes and drivers of home value. Answer questions through charts and statistical tests.
> - Construct a model to predict assessed home value for single family properties using regression techniques.
> - Make recommendations to a data science team about how to improve predictions.
> - Refine my work into a report, in the form of a jupyter notebook, that I will walk through in a 5 minute presentation to a group of collegues and managers about my goals, the work I did, why, what I found, my methodologies, and my conclusions.
> - Be prepared to answer panel questions about my code, process, findings and key takeaways, and model.

## Project Description

### Business Goals

> - Construct a ML Regression model that predicts property tax assessed values ('taxvaluedollarcnt') of **Single Family Properties** using attributes of the properties.
> - Find the key drivers of property value for single family properties.
> - Deliver a report that the data science team can read through and replicate, understand what steps were taken, why and what the outcome was.
> - Make recommendations on what works or doesn't work in predicting these homes' values.

### Deliverables

> - **Readme (.md)**
> - **Acquire & Prepare Modeules (Wrangle) (.py)**
> - **Final Report (.ipynb)**
> - 5 min Live Presentation
